							Quadratic Solver User Story

	1. User can enter a, b, c of the quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c=0) for which they'd like a solution.
		Priority:10
		Estimate:1
		Example: qSolve(Double a, Double b, double c, double x1, double x2);

	2.Display to the user the solution(the roots)
		Priority:10
		Estimate:1

	2. Display to the user if they roots of the number are (complex) or (real)numbers
		#define COMPLEX : 0
		#define Real:1
		Priority:6
		Estimate:1


	3. If the results are both equal then display to the user "Roots are Equal"
		Priority:2
		Estimate:1
	4. Does the solution contain a double or a two or an error
		
		
		#define DOUBLE	: 2
		#define TWO : 3
		#define EOF : -1
